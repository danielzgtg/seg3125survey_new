## Layout

Layout from previous labs (and the respective sources) were used.

## Assets

Assets are stored at in the res/ folder on the `source` branch. None of the work in that folder is mine.

These are considered images and fonts, not code.

Please see various CREDITS.md files on the `source` branch for attribution.

## Preprocessing

This project indirectly depends on many NPM packages.

As seen in previous labs, this lab uses preprocessing.
This is used for testing, documentation, and commenting.
Bootstrap also recommends this.
This does not make essence of the output code differ much from my original code.

The `handin` branch contains runnable code. The `source` branch contains source code.

## Output

`(main|results).[contentHash].(js|css)`, and `(index|results).html` have my code inside.
`framework.[...].css` has been considerably modified by my SCSS extends.
All other files are completely third-party.

## Bundling

This project bundles dependencies for the same reasons as the previous labs.

See the `source` branch for the code without bundling.
